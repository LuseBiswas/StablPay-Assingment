## 💭 Design Decisions & Assumptions

1. **State Management**
   - Used React's built-in useState for local state management
   - LocalStorage for data persistence
   - Prop drilling for theme management (could be improved with Context)

2. **Component Architecture**
   - Modular components for better maintainability
   - Shared components for consistent UI elements
   - Responsive design breakpoints at common device sizes

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Lazy loading for components
   - Optimized re-renders
   - Efficient state updates

## 🔄 Future Improvements

1. **Technical Enhancements**
   - Implement Redux/Context for better state management
   - Add TypeScript for better type safety
   - Integrate with a backend API
   - Add unit and integration tests
   - Implement PWA capabilities

2. **Feature Additions**
   - User authentication system
   - Real-time notifications
   - Multiple language support
   - Advanced filtering and sorting options
   - Payment integration
   - Reviews and ratings system

3. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - More animation and transitions
   - Skeleton loading states
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Accessibility improvements
   - More customization options
